            Number to month(1-12) and print number of days of that month
            Write a program that prompts the user to enter a month number (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.) and outputs the number of days in that month. Assume that                    February has 28 days.
          
            In this program, we use a switch-case statement to handle different month numbers entered by the user. The switch statement checks the value of the variable month,              and executes the corresponding case block. If none of the cases match, the default block is executed
